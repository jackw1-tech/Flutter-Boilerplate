1.	Clone this repository:

2.	Make the script executable:

chmod +x create_flutter_app.sh

3.	Run the script with your desired project name:

./create_flutter_app.sh my_app_name

This will:

	‚Ä¢	Applies the project_name dynamically so your app is properly named
	‚Ä¢	Automates the boring setup process
